# Introduction
Hello, my name is **Razo**:zzz: (aka *psycho*![](images/favicon.ico)) and I'm a mSL enthusiast. I usually reside on the irc network [Undernet](irc://irc.undernet.org/psycho) I can also be found on [#mSL@ChatHub](irc://irc.chathub.org/msl) and  [#mIRCscriptting@SwiftIRC](irc://irc.swiftirc.net/mIRCscripting)

## Background
I started IRC back in the 90s when dial-up was still a thing, and it has been a crazy ride ever since. 

It was only recently that I started scripting again, blame the pandemic >_<
